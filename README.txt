The idea: A program that simulates a grocery store during some length of time. It keeps track of average waiting times for customers per cashier (perhaps I will add functionality to write the data to a text file or excel spreadsheet). If the wait time gets above a certain threshold, a new register opens up, adding to the pool of available registers. It is just a contrived way for me to practice using linked lists, queues, and OOP in C++, but also seems like fun. I plan to make changes to it to be more 'game-like', and maybe implement it in Unreal Engine.
